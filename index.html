    <h2 class="subheader"> <b> About Me </b> </h2>

    <p>My name is Priscila Garcia-Mendoza, and I am an emerging tech professional looking to break into the tech field. Currently, I am enrolled in a workforce training program called Year Up Puget Sound, where I am gaining the skills and knowledge needed in software development.</p>

    <p>With a strong passion for technology that started at a young age, I have been continuously drawn to the ever-evolving world of tech. I believe that technology plays an essential role in shaping our future, and I am very excited to be a part of the generation that drives that innovation in this field.</p>

    <p>Throughout my work experience in various industries such as retail, food, and healthcare, I have developed exceptional customer service and a diligent work ethic. These valuable skills have shaped me into a well-rounded individual, ready to contribute to the tech industry.</p>

    <p>From my earliest exposure to computer classes in elementary school to my college years, I developed a genuine passion for and deepened my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This led me to pursue further education and training, which brought me to Year Up. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge by learning various programming languages, including Python, with the ultimate goal of becoming a skilled front-end software developer.</p>

    <p>I am eager to showcase my strong customer service and problem-solving abilities to contribute positively to a progressive and innovative company. You can find links to my personal projects, LinkedIn profile, and GitHub above. Please feel free to connect with me over LinkedIn, where we can explore potential business opportunities and engage in meaningful discussions! </p>

    <h3 class="subheader"> <b> Fun Facts! </b> </h3>
    <p>When I am not immersed in coding, I enjoy spending time outdoors, going on hikes, and having picnics under the sun. Staying active at the gym is also an important part of my routine. Indoors, I find relaxation and joy in activities like binge-watching shows, crocheting, and playing video games.</p>
