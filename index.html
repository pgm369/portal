    <p>Hello, my name is Priscila Garcia-Mendoza! I am an emerging professional at a workforce training program called Year Up Puget Sound.</p>

    <p>I have been working since I was 15 years old and fell in love with all things tech. We are the future generation and tech plays an important role in the future.</p>

    <p>I have worked in retail and in the food industry and I am extremely grateful. These jobs have grown my customer service and hard work ethic.</p>

    <p>Ever since elementary school, I have loved computer classes from learning Office Word to my time in college when I really got into the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript! </p>

    <p>When I started learning the basics in Software development, I strived for more and came across Year Up which is what I am doing right now! I am currently gaining more knowledge in various languages especially Python. My goal is to become a Software Developer!</p>

    <p>I would love the opportunity to display and offer my strong customer service and problem-solving skills for the right company. Thank you for reading! I have attached links with my personal projects, LinkedIn, and GitHub above! Feel free to reach out on LinkedIn and we can chat over future business opportunites! </p>
